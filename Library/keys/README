keys - secure credential storage

  keys is a client/server application designed to provide secure and
  portable storage of sensitive information such as authentication
  credentials, banking information, contact details, etc.

  The keys client is a command line application which communicates with
  a server, typically running on an Android phone. All data is stored
  securely on the server and accessible to link-local clients with a
  valid certificate and knowledge of the database password.

  Users with stronger security requirements could run the server on a
  hardened device with minimal IO ports and no permanent storage. keys
  should run on most devices with a reasonably POSIX compatible OS.

  keys uses IPv6 multicast and link-local addressing, so the client and
  server must be on the same local, IPv6 capable, device or network.

Security

  All credential data is encrypted using a cascade of NaCl's XSalsa20
  and Poly1305 secretbox followed by AES-256 in GCM mode. Each cipher
  is keyed with half of the database key which is 64 bytes of random
  data. The database key itself is encrypted with the same cascade,
  AES256-GCM(k0, XSalsa20Poly1305(k1, ...)), with keys derived from
  the user's password via the scrypt KDF.

  Clients communicate with the server using TLS 1.2 with cipher suite
  TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384. The server and client are
  mutually authenticated with X.509 certificates and the corresponding
  public and private keys are generated on the server device.

  Please review the SECURITY file for details.

  WARNING: the keys code has not been reviewed by any 3rd party and
  the author makes no guarantee of fitness for any purpose.

Initialization

  When the keys mobile app is first started it initializes the database,
  generates a random password, and generates client and server SSL
  certificates. The certificates must be downloaded from the device and
  stored on the client, typically in ~/.keys.

  Alternatively the --init <dir> and --kdfp <N,r,p> options may be used
  to initialize a local database which can then be accessed by running
  keys with the --server option.

Usage

  When the keys server is running entries may be added, deleted, edited,
  and retrieved. Each entry is a set of key/value fields and one value,
  of the "name" field by convention, should uniquely identify the entry.

  The default entry template has four fields, for example:

        name: foo
    username: bar
    password: ovdI6emYcc
       extra: baz

  An entry may have an arbitrary number of fields and the values are
  indexed for retrieval, however fields whose name begins with "pass"
  are excluded from the index.

Import/Export

  The --export and --import options allow a keys database to be exported
  to a single encrypted file and later imported. This is useful for
  backups and when moving the database to a new or restored device.

  The security of an export file may be increased by using a very strong
  random password and harder scrypt KDF parameters.
